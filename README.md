#Bike and Walk Web App

The goal of this app is to create an on-line traffic counting tool primarily targeted 
at non-profit and community groups promoting active transportation in their local areas
by giving them a way to collect, store and access traffic count information.

The system is designed to be very flexible in the types of traffic and behaviors that are
tracked. Once collected, the information is immediately available on the internet for viewing,
download and analysis by any of the organizations participating in the system.
